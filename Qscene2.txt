Queen: Finally, I’ve been waiting for ages. Here help me get this corset on.
After a long silence…
You: Soooo, are you excited for the wedding?
Queen: I don't want to talk about it.
Another long silence later…
Queen: I can't believe I'm going through with this.
You: It seems like you want to talk about it…
Queen: I hate him! If my father would let me I would kill him and take the throne for myself, but nooo, apparently it's “safer” this way.
Queen: You weren't supposed to hear that. Well I guess I'll have to dispose of another servant, what a shame.
You: My queen, the kingdom has been weakened by the leadership of that fool king. My loyalty is to you and only you.
Queen: Well in that case… Go talk to the bishop during the rehearsal dinner. If you really are loyal to me, I might have a job for you.
